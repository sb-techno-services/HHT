          <h3 class="service-box-title">Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji</h3><br>
          
          <p>Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji (Sri Swamiji) is the founder and Life President of the charity, Sri Datta Yoga Centre (UK) (Sri DYC UK) which operates under an appointed Board of Trustees.</p>
          <strong>Brief History</strong>
          <p>A Muslim saint (Sufi master) predicted to Sri Swamiji’s parents (Sri Narasimha Sastri and Jayalskhmi Mata) that their child would have supreme wisdom and knowledge and was destined to uplift mankind.</p>
          <p>Sri Swamiji was born on 26 May 1942 in Mekedatu, a village in South India.  The actual birth occurred on a rock situated at a confluence of 3 auspicious rivers named as Kaveri, Arkavati and Guptagamini.  At birth, Sri Swamiji was named Satyanarayana and was gifted from birth with great knowledge and power.</p>
          <p>As a child, Sri Swamiji has:</p>
          <ul>
          	<li>Preached as per Hindu Vedic practise</li>
            <li>Sang religious hymns</li>
            <li>Taught Hatha and Kriya Yoga</li>
            <li>Counselled his followers on domestic and spiritual problems</li>
           </ul>
           
           <p>In 1966 he moved to the city of Mysore and founded the Ashram as we know today called “Avadhoota Datta Peetham and changed his name to Sri Ganapathy Sachchidananda Swamiji.  Since 1966, Sri Swamiji has greatly expanded his services to uplift mankind all around the world some of which have been outlined below.</p>
           <strong>Music Therapy (Music for Meditation and Healing) </strong>
           <p>Sri Swamiji has composed music by the use of a Synthesizer creating musical tunes (Raga’s) that help the body to heal.  In Yoga it states that the astral body has 72,000 nerve lets and 14 major nerve Channels (Nadi’s).  Each Nadi vibrates at its own frequency.  The theory behind Music Therapy is that Music helps by making Nadi’s vibrate at there proper frequency thus causing a soothing effect.  Music becomes a therapy when the healer, musicians and listeners all deeply concentrate on the sound.</p>
           <strong>Sri Swamiji preaches that: </strong> 
			<ul>
                <li>People that concentrate on the sound and tunes of his music for therapy will benefit</li>
                <li>Physical health is improved if you have a healthy mind</li>
                <li>Music of the right type helps in achieving relaxation by soothing the nerves and through that, comes peace and stillness of the mind</li>
           </ul>
           <strong>Music for Devotion</strong>
           <p>Sri Swamiji has composed many new compositions of devotional songs for worship via the use of the Synthesizer.  His compositions are based on Carnatic classical tunes (Raga’s) which have been recognised by scholars and pandits from the musical community.  Sri Swamiji has devoted his life to music ensuring that for any Hindu occasion there are appropriate religious tunes (Bhajan’s) and the followers of Sri Swamiji understand the meaning and therefore sing with devotion.  Sri Swami’s life mission for music has meant that the Bhajan’s remain current and the genre of music appeals to all age groups.</p>
