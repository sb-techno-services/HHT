        <li>Any of our sister organisations both in the EEA and outside of the EEA.</li>

        <li>We will also disclose info to protect / defend the rights, property, or safety of DYCUK or HHT, or others. This includes exchanging information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
        <li>We will not sell or share your personal data to others.</li>

<h3 class="service-box-title">Security</h3>
<strong>Where we store and process your personal data </strong> 
<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure password protected computer.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<strong>Retention of your data</strong>
<p>We understand our legal duty to retain accurate data and only retain personal data for as long as we need it for our charity work and interests.  Accordingly, we have a data retention notice and run data routines to remove data that we no longer have a legitimate business interest in maintaining.</p>

<strong>We do the following to try to ensure our data is accurate:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We check that we have accurate information about you.</li>
<li>We keep in touch with you so you can let us know of changes to your personal data.</li>
<li>We conduct regular data audits to ensure the information we hold about you is still relevant for the purpose for which it is intended.</li>

</ul>
<strong>The criteria we use to determine whether we should retain your personal data includes:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>the nature of the personal data;</li>
    <li>its perceived accuracy;</li>
    <li>our legal obligations;</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="service-box-title">Consent</h3>
<strong>Your rights</strong>  
<p>The Data Protection Act 1998 and the GDPR give you the right to access information held about you.</p>

<p>However, if a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, DYCUK or HHT is not obliged to comply with it. Alternatively, DYCUK or HHT can agree to respond but may charge a fee, which will be based on the administrative cost of responding to the request.</p>

<strong>The GDPR further provides you with the following rights.</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.</li>
    <li>Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).</li>
    <li>Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.</li>
    <li>Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.</li>
    <li>Request transfer of your personal information to another party in certain formats, if practicable.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you wish to exercise any of these rights you should, in the first instance email DYCUK/HHT at mail@dycuk.org</p>
